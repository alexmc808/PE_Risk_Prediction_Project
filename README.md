# PE_Risk_Prediction_Project
This repository presents a supervised machine learning approach to predict the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), using the MIMIC-IV clinical database. The project uses Google BigQuery, Python, and standard data science libraries to build, evaluate, and interpret models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. A special focus is given to comparing treatment types (anticoagulation, thrombolytics, mechanical thrombectomy, catheter-directed thrombolysis) and how treatment timing affects PE risk.
